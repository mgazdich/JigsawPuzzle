# JigsawPuzzle

Ipad application I made that when creating a new game, the timer begins and positions the pieces randomly on the board.

The pieces can be dragged by the user, and once it gets within a certain proximity of the correct space, it will snap into place and play a "click" sound.

After solving the puzzle, it will play an applause sound, have an animation, and depending on the speed of solving it, present the user with a message.
